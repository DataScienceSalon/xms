abstract = {Majority of the currently used predictive text entry systems (like T9 for lower end mobile phones) do not provide word prediction. In these systems, the average number of key-taps per word is high resulting in higher typing efforts on the part of the user. At times, T9 provides options (words) that may not fit into the context of the message, are wrong grammatically and are not valid English words. Also, T9 is slower to adapt to usage patterns. PreText predicts the word that the user is typing with the help of grammar rules for the English language, making word prediction more precise, reducing the number of key taps required, saving the user's time and achieving an optimisation over the existing systems. It also adapts to the user's usage pattern with the help of a frequency model. The metric used here to evaluate the performance of text entry systems is KSPC [1] (keystrokes per character). The KSPC was found to be 0.7360 for PreText, providing an average improvement of 26.91{\%} over T9 which has a KSPC of 1.023 [1].},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The economic burden of depression in the United States--including major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder, and dysthymia--was estimated at {\$}83.1 billion in 2000. We update these findings using recent data, focusing on MDD alone and accounting for comorbid physical and psychiatric disorders.\backslashn\backslashnMETHOD: Using national survey (DSM-IV criteria) and administrative claims data (ICD-9 codes), we estimate the incremental economic burden of individuals with MDD as well as the share of these costs attributable to MDD, with attention to any changes that occurred between 2005 and 2010.\backslashn\backslashnRESULTS: The incremental economic burden of individuals with MDD increased by 21.5{\%} (from {\$}173.2 billion to {\$}210.5 billion, inflation-adjusted dollars). The composition of these costs remained stable, with approximately 45{\%} attributable to direct costs, 5{\%} to suicide-related costs, and 50{\%} to workplace costs. Only 38{\%} of the total costs were due to MDD itself as opposed to comorbid conditions.\backslashn\backslashnCONCLUSIONS: Comorbid conditions account for the largest portion of the growing economic burden of MDD. Future research should analyze further these comorbidities as well as the relative importance of factors contributing to that growing burden. These include population growth, increase in MDD prevalence, increase in treatment cost per individual with MDD, changes in employment and treatment rates, as well as changes in the composition and quality of MDD treatment services.},

abstract = {Text prediction is an application of language models to mobile devices. Currently, the state of the art models use neural networks. Unfortunately, mobile devices are constrainted in both computing power and space and are thus unable to run most (if not all) neural networks. Recently, however, character-level architectures have appeared that have outperformed previous architectures for machine transla-tion. They are advantageous in that they do not require a word embedding matrix and thus require a lot less space. This project evaluates one recent character-level architecture on the text prediction task. We find that the network performs qual-itatively well, as well as achieving perplexity levels close to existing methods on the Brown corpus.},

@book{Zipf1935,
abstract = {Frequency counts of phonemes, morphemes, and words in samples of written discourse in diverse languages are presented in support of the generalization that the more complex any speech element, the less frequently does it occur. Thus, the greater the frequency of occurrence of words, the less tends to be their average length, and the smaller also is the number of different words. The relation between frequency and number of different words is said to be expressed by the formula ab2 = k, in which a represents the number of different words of a given frequency and b the frequency. The relationship between the magnitude of speech elements and their frequency is attributed to the operation of a "law" of linguistic change: that as the frequency of phonemes or of linguistic forms increases, their magnitude decreases. There is thus a tendency to "maintain an equilibrium" between length and frequency, and this tendency rests upon an "underlying law of economy." Human beings strive to maintain an "emotional equilibrium" between variety and repetitiveness of environmental factors and behavior. A speaker's discourse must represent a compromise between variety and repetitiveness adapted to the hearer's "tolerable limits of change in maintaining emotional equilibrium." This accounts for the maintenance of the relationship ab2 = k; the exponent of b expresses this "rate of variegation."},

abstract = {Building probabilistic models of language is a central task in natural language and speech processing allowing to integrate the syntactic and/or semantic (and recently pragmatic) constraints of the language into the systems. Probabilistic language models are an attractive alternative to the more traditional rule-based systems, such as context free grammars, because of the recent availability of massive amount of text corpora which can be used to efficiently train the models and because instead of binary grammaticality judgement offered by the rule-based systems, likelihood of any sequence of lexical units can be obtained, which is a crucial factor in such tasks as speech recognition. Probabilistic language models also find their application in part-of-speech tagging, machine translation, semantic disambiguation and numerous other fields. The most widely used language models are based on the estimation of the proba-bility of observing a given lexical unit conditioned on the observations of n−1 preced-ing lexical units, and are known as n-gram models. When the n-gram estimates are poor, whatever the reason for that may be, a technique called smoothing is applied to adjust the estimates and hopefully produce more accurate model. Smoothing techniques may be roughly divided into the backing-off and interpolation. In the first case, the best n-gram model in the current context is selected, whereas in the second case all the n-gram models of different specificities are combined together to form a better predictor. In this thesis, a recently proposed novel interpolation scheme is investigated, namely, the log-linear interpolation. Unlike the original publication, however, which dealt with combining the models of unrelated nature, the aim of this thesis is to formulate the theoretical framework for smoothing the n-gram probability estimates obtained from similar language models with different levels of specificity on the same corpus, which will be called log-linear n-gram smoothing, and compare it to the well-established linear interpolation and back-off methods. The framework being proposed includes probability combination, parameter optimisation, dealing with data sparsity and parameter clustering. The resulting technique is shown to outperform the conventional linear interpo-lation and back-off techniques when applied to the n-gram smoothing tasks. ii},

abstract = {A random sample is drawn from a population of animals of various species. (The theory may also be applied to studies of literary vocabulary, for example.) If a particular species is represented r times in the sample of size N, then r/N is not a good estimate of the population frequency, p, when r is small. Methods are given for estimating p, assuming virtually nothing about the underlying population. The estimates are expressed in terms of smoothed values of the numbers nr (r = 1, 2, 3...), where nr is the number of distinct species that are each represented r times in the sample. (nr may be described as `the frequency of the frequency r'.) Turing is acknowledged for the most interesting formula in this part of the work. An estimate of the proportion of the population represented by the species occurring in the sample is an immediate corollary. Estimates are made of measures of heterogeneity of the population, including Yule's characteristic' and Shannon's entropy'. Methods are then discussed that do depend on assumptions about the underlying population. It is here that most work has been done by other writers. It is pointed out that a hypothesis can give a good fit to the numbers nr but can give quite the wrong value for Yule's characteristic. An example of this is Fisher's fit to some data of Williams's on Macrolepidoptera.},

Abstract: This paper presents an automatic method for reducing the part-of-speech tagset to be considered by a word prediction system in Portuguese. The method is based on a similarity measure applied to a association matrix, generated by em-ploying a odds ratio association measure in the bigrams of parts-of-speech (bipos) probability distribution in a corpus. The results reported in this paper show that using the proposed clustering method with an appropriate threshold value over the similarity has the potential to improve the word prediction system. Moreover, it makes possible to use new clustering techniques such as fuzzy clustering. The re-sults also show that when using a word prediction system based on a syntactic model, the clustering cannot be performed between the major syntactic categories, even if the clusters generated seem correct from a linguistic point of view.},

abstract = {This article is one of a series of short essays, collectively titled " Further Explorations, " published as part of a special issue of Oral Tradition in honor of John Miles Foley's 65 th birthday and 2011 retirement. The surprise Festschrift, guest-edited by Lori and Scott Garner entirely without his knowledge, celebrates John's tremendous impact on studies in oral tradition through a series of essays contributed by his students from the University of Missouri-Columbia (1979-present) and from NEH Summer Seminars that he has directed (1987-1996). http://journal.oraltradition.org/issues/26ii In The Pathways Project, John Miles Foley (2011-) discusses briefly the social role of SMS (Short Message Service), suggesting that " even so-called text messaging, a misnomer of sizeable proportions given that the activity really amounts to a long-distance emergent communication enacted virtually, knits people together into interactive groups and keeps them connected and 'present' to one another. " 1 In this essay, I propose a merger of current research on text messaging and the study of oral traditions in order to shed light on the relationship between this new mode of communication and the workings of consciousness being transformed by the eAgora. Focusing first on the limitations of text messaging as a medium that unexpectedly encouraged language innovation, we can explore how text messaging language merges effective communicative practices from both oral and written technologies in order to generate more efficient communication within a newly-limited, writing-based technology. Moreover, in addition to its efficiency, the kind of linguistic play found in text messaging can be viewed as a source of pleasure for those who engage in texting (" texters "). Thus, by employing the discourse of orality and literacy, we can explain how text messaging, while impossible to imagine without the myriad writing technologies mastered before it, actually encourages its literacy-obsessed users to practice communicative techniques more often found within oral cultures, or more precisely, communicative techniques found in cultures in the incipient stages of literacy. Such cultures are ripe for language innovation precisely because they have begun to record knowledge but have not yet standardized the recording procedure. Coincident with a perspective that sees text messaging as bridging a consciousness gap between oral and literate cultures, then, is the recognition that close study of the ways in which text messaging reworks language could lead to fruitful discoveries about the most current ways in which Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC) directs human life toward ever-emerging horizons of consciousness. When David Crystal (2008) hyperbolized the emergence of text messaging in the following passage, this form of communication was already a well-developed medium. Nevertheless, his humorous figuring of text messaging's inception, while not quite accurate, highlights precisely the form's limits that made it such an unlikely competitor in the tightly-wound market of twenty-first-century technologies (173-74): Oral Tradition, 26/2 (2011): 637-624},

First, semantic relatives are found for English words, specifically for nouns, and they form the semantic knowledge base. The selection process for these semantically related words is first to rank the pointwise mutual information of co-occurring words in a large corpus and then to identify the semantic relatedness of these words by a Lesk-like filter. Then, the semantic knowledge is used to measure the semantic association of completion candidates with the context. Those that are semantically appropriate to the context are promoted to the top positions in prediction lists due to their high association with context. Experimental results show a performance improvement when using the integrated model for the completion of nouns.},

abstract = {Many disabled persons in the world are unable to communicate verbally with those around them. This may be because they have motor-control diiculties and so cannot operate the muscles which actually produce the speech. Conversely, i t m a y be a neurophysiological problem, either congenital or as a result of trauma, resulting in an inability of the brain to create the speech in the place. Either way the diiculties inherent with such problems are immense, and anything which can be used to help the situation can bring welcome relief. Many people have n o v erbal communication skills at all and as such need some form of prosthetic aid known as an Augmentative and Alternative Communication AAC device. There are many forms of device from very basic pointing boards to complex computer systems and a device will be chosen to suit the needs and abilities of an individual. However, people with such diiculties often have their problems compounded by not being able to use the rest of their bodies properly either. If one cannot use one's voice box because of motor-control diiculties then it is very likely that one will not be able to co-ordinate limbs properly. As such, using a complex device can be very diicult, and needless to say time consuming. For instance, typing on a keyboard can become an almost impossible task. The most common method of operating an AAC device is with a single switch, selecting the letters one-by-one as the system scans through them on a screen or lightboard. This produces prohibitively slow communication rates and as a consequence, even using an ordinary AAC device, users cannot join in with a normal conversation. A method is required which will improve the rate at which users can participate in a conversation using an AAC device.},

Here we present a general framework for deriving smoothed language model probabilities from BFs. We investigate how a BF containing n-gram statistics can be used as a direct replacement for a conventional n-gram model. Recent work has demonstrated that corpus statistics can be stored efficiently within a BF, here we consider how smoothed language model probabilities can be derived efficiently from this randomised representation. Our proposal takes advantage of the one-sided error guarantees of the BF and simple inequalities that hold between related n-gram statistics in order to further reduce the BF storage requirements and the error rate of the derived probabilities. We use these models as replacements for a conventional language model in machine translation experiments.},

abstract = {—Using social media tools such as blogs and forums have become more and more popular in recent years. Hence, a huge collection of social media texts from different communities is available for accessing user opinions, e.g., for marketing studies or acceptance research. Typically, methods from Natural Language Processing are applied to social media texts to automatically recognize user opinions. A fundamental component of the linguistic pipeline in Natural Language Processing is Part-of-Speech tagging. Most state-of-the-art Part-of-Speech taggers are trained on newspaper corpora, which differ in many ways from non-standardized social media text. Hence, applying common taggers to such texts results in performance degradation. In this paper, we present extensions to a basic Markov model tagger for the annotation of social media texts. Considering the German standard Stuttgart/ ubinger TagSet (STTS), we distinguish 54 tag classes. Applying our approach improves the tagging accuracy for social media texts considerably, when we train our model on a combination of annotated texts from newspapers and Web comments.},

We identify and evaluate techniques for improving English part-of-speech tagging performance in this genre. Further, we present a novel approach to system combination for the case where available taggers use different tagsets, based on voteconstrained bootstrapping with unlabeled data. Coupled with assigning prior probabilities to some tokens and handling of unknown words and slang, we reach 88.7{\%} tagging accuracy (90.5{\%} on development data). This is a new high in PTB-compatible tweet part-of-speech tagging, reducing token error by 26.8{\%} and sentence error by 12.2{\%}. The model, training data and tools are made available.},

abstract = {Word completion is a basic technology for reducing the effort involved in text entry on mobile devices and in augmentative communication devices, where efficiency and ease of use are needed, but where a low memory footprint is also required. Standard solutions compress a lexicon into a suffix tree with a small memory footprint and high retrieval speed. Keystroke savings, a measurable correlate of text entry effort gain, typically improve when the algorithm would also take into account the previous word; however, this comes at the cost of a large footprint. We develop two word completion algorithms that encode the previous word in the input. The first algorithm utilizes a character buffer that includes a fixed number of recent keystrokes, including those belonging to previous words. The second algorithm includes the complete previous word as an extra input feature. In simulation studies, the first algorithm yields marked improvements in keystroke savings, but has a large memory footprint. The second algorithm can be tuned by frequency thresholding to have a small footprint, and be less than one order of magnitude slower than the baseline system, while its keystroke savings improve over the baseline.},

This paper considers various ways in which different corpora can be compared more objectively. First we address the issue, 'which words are particularly characteristic of a corpus?', reviewing and critiquing the statistical methods which have been applied to the question and proposing the use of the Mann-Whitney ranks test. Results of two corpus com-parisons using the ranks test are presented. Then, we consider measures for corpus similarity. After discussing limitations of the idea of corpus similarity, we present a method for evaluat-ing corpus similarity measures. We consider several measures and establish that a $\chi$ 2 -based one performs best. All methods considered in this paper are based on word and ngram fre-quencies; the strategy is defended.},

abstract = {Prediction is one of the most extended techniques to enhance the rate of communication for people with motor and speech impairments who use Augmentative and Alternative Communication systems. There is an enormous diversity of prediction methods and techniques mentioned in the literature. Therefore, the designer finds tremendous difficulties in understanding and comparing them in order to decide the most convenient technique for a specific design. This paper presents a survey on prediction techniques applied to communicators with the intention of helping them to understand this field. Prediction applications and related features, such as block size, dictionary structure, prediction method, interface, special features, measurement and results, are detailed. Systems found in the literature are studied and described. Finally, a discussion is carried out on the possible comparison among the different methods. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2004.},

abstract = {Interest in word-formation is probably as old as interest in language itself. As Dr. Bauer points out in his Introduction, many of the questions that scholars are asking now were also being asked in the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. However, there is still little agreement on methodology in the study of word-formation or theoretical approaches to it; even the kind of data relevant to its study is open to debate. Dr. Bauer here provides students and general linguists alike with a new perspective on what is a confused and often controversial field of study, providing a resolution to the terminological confusion which currently reigns in this area. In doing so, he clearly demonstrates the challenge and intrinsic fascination of the study of word-formation. Linguists have recently become increasingly aware of the relevance of word-formation to work in syntax and semantics, phonology and morphology, and Dr Bauer discusses - within a largely synchronic and transformational framework - the theoretical issues involved. He considers topics where word-formation has a contribution to make to other areas of linguistics and, without pretending to provide a fully-fledged theory of word-formation, develops those points which he sees as being central to its study. -- Publisher description. 1.

In particular, against a backdrop of media commentaries, we examine the linguistic forms and communicative functions in a corpus of 544 participants' actual text-messages. While young people are surely using their mobile phones as a novel, creative means of enhancing and supporting intimate relationships and existing social networks, popular discourses about the linguistic exclusivity and impenetrability of this particular technologically-mediated discourse appear greatly exaggerated. Serving the sociolinguistic 'maxims' of (a) brevity and speed, (b) paralinguistic restitution and (c) phonological approximation, young people's messages are both linguistically unremarkable and communicatively adept.},

A computer program performing word prediction can be an important writing aid for physically or linguistically handicapped people. Using a word predictor ensures correct spelling and saves keystrokes and effort for the user. The goal of this project was to design and implement a word predictor for Swedish that would suggest better words, and thus save more keystrokes, than any other word predictor available on the market. The constructed program uses a probabilistic language model based on the well-established ideas of the trigram predictor developed at IBM. By using such a model, the program can be easily modified to work with languages other than Swedish. In tests, the program has been shown to save more than 45 percent of the keystrokes for the user. The report focuses on the technical aspects of designing an efficient algorithm and optimizing it to save as many keystrokes as possible.

@article{Evert2005,
abstract = {You shall know a word by the company it keeps! With this slogan, Firth (1957) drew attention to a fact that language scholars had intuitively known for a long time: In natural language, words are not combined randomly into phrases and sentences, con- strained only by the rules of syntax. The particular ways in which they go together are a rich and important source of information both about language and about the world we live in. In the 1930s, J. R. Firth coined the term collocations for such char- acteristic, or habitual word combinations (as he called them). While Firth used to be lamentably vague about his precise understanding of this concept (cf. Lehr 1996, 21), the term itself and the general idea behind it that collocations correspond to some conventional way of saying things (Manning and Sch{\"{u}}tze 1999, 151) were eagerly taken up by researchers in various fields, leading to the serious terminolog- ical confusion that surrounds the concept of collocations today. As Choueka puts it: even though any two lexicographers would agree that once upon a time, hit the road and similar idioms are collocations, they would most certainly disagree on al- most anything else (Choueka 1988, 4). Feel free to replace lexicographers with any profession that is concerned with language data.},

abstract = {The practical challenge of creating a Hungarian e-mail reader has initiated our work on statistical text analysis. The starting point was statistical analysis for automatic discrimination of the language of texts. Later it was extended to automatic re-generation of diacritic signs and more detailed language structure analysis. Parallel study of three different languages -Hungarian. German and English -using text corpora of similar size explores both similarities and differences. Corpora of publicly available Internet sources were used. The corpus size was the same (approximately 20Mbytes, 2.5-3.5 million word forms) for all languages. Besides traditional corpus coverage, word length and occurence statistics, some new features about prosodic boundaries (sentence beginning and final positions, preceding and following a comma) were also computed. Among others, it was found, that the coverage of corpora by the most frequent words follows a parallel logarithmic rule for all languages in the 40-85{\%} coverage range, known as Zipf's law in linguistics. The functions are much nearer for English and German than for Hungarian. Further conclusions are also drawn. The language detection and diacritic re-generation applications are discussed in detail with implications on Hungarian speech generation. Diverse further application domains, such as predictive text input, word hyphenation, language modeling in speech recognition, corpus-based speech synthesis, etc. are also foreseen.},

abstract = {Users with reduced physical functioning such as ALS patients need more time and effort to operate computers. Most of the previous assistive technologies use prefix based predictive text input algorithms. Prefix based predictive text entry is suitable for languages such as English where the average word length is approximately 5 characters. Other languages such as Norwegian and German have longer mean word lengths as words are combined into longer compound words and prefix approaches are thus less effective. This paper proposes a new abbreviation expansion algorithm. Users mentally determine an abbreviation of the word, typically comprising significant consonants and the system proposes words that contain the matched characters. The approach is non disruptive in that it does not require the user to learn a new system or abbreviation mnemonics, and it can be used with any text input device. The system is dynamic and adapts to the users style of abbreviated input. The algorithm is easier to implement than previous approaches and no a priori system training is required. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that the algorithm achieves real time performance with modest computer hardware.},

The composite language model has been trained by performing a convergent N-best list approximate EM algorithm and a follow-up EM algorithm to improve word prediction power on corpora with up to a billion tokens and stored on a supercomputer. The large scale distributed composite language model gives drastic perplexity reduction over n-grams and achieves significantly better translation quality measured by the Bleu score and "readability" of translations when applied to the task of re-ranking the N-best list from a state-of-the-art parsing-based machine translation system.},

In this class, you will learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting them to work for yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not only the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new problems. Finally, you'll learn about some of Silicon Valley's best practices in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI. This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.},

We propose a Context Based Word Prediction system for SMS messaging in which context is used to predict the most appropriate word for a given code. We extend this system to allow informal words (short forms for proper English words). The mapping from informal word to its proper English words is done using Double Metaphone Encoding based on their phonetic similarity. The results show 31{\%} improvement over the traditional frequency based word estimation. Introduction The growth of wireless technology has provided us with many new ways of communication such as SMS (Short Message Service). SMS messaging can also be used to interact with automated systems or participating in contests. With tremendous increase in Mobile Text Messaging, there is a need for an efficient text input system. With limited keys on the mobile phone, multiple letters are mapped to same number (8 keys, 2 to 9, for 26 alphabets).

A computer program performing word prediction can be an important writing aid for physically or linguistically handicapped people. Using a word predictor ensures correct spelling and saves keystrokes and effort for the user. The goal of this project was to design and implement a word predictor for Swedish that would suggest better words, and thus save more keystrokes, than any other word predictor available on the market. The constructed program uses a probabilistic language model based on the well-established ideas of the trigram predictor developed at IBM. By using such a model, the program can be easily modified to work with languages other than Swedish. In tests, the program has been shown to save more than 45 percent of the keystrokes for the user. The report focuses on the technical aspects of designing an efficient algorithm and optimizing it to save as many keystrokes as possible.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Word prediction may be of great help in situations where text entering is cumbersome due to a physical or a cognitive disability, or due to the input device being small. Traditionally, word prediction has solely been based on statistic language modelling, but lately knowledge-based approaches, including the use of grammatical language descriptions, have entered the arena. By making use of grammar rules, the accuracy of the prediction suggestions is expected to increase, and the word predictor to give a more intelligent impression. We have defined and implemented a Swedish grammar for the FASTY word predictor. The gram- mar rules, defined in terms of traditional grammatical functions, are expressed in the procedural UCP- formalism. The grammar functions as a grammar checking filter, reranking the suggestions proposed by a statistic n-gram model on the basis of both confirming and rejecting rules. What structures to cover has been decided in accordance with an investigation on what syntactic errors are most frequently produced by the statistic model. The investigation led us to prioritize rules for handling word order in the main clause, agreement within the noun phrase, verb inflection and prepositional phrases. A preliminary evaluation of the grammar module was carried out, using Keystroke Saving Rate (KSR) estimations. The results showed only a slight improvement in KSR when adding the grammar module to the system, as compared to using only the statistic model based on word form bigrams and part-of-speech tag trigrams. A list length of one suggestion gave a larger improvement, than a list length of five, indicating that the strength of the grammar module lies in the reranking of already displayed suggestions, rather than the addition of new suggestions to a long list of suggestions.},

The paper distinguishes among various ways that linguistic features can be distributed within and across texts; it analyses the distributions of several particular features, and it discusses the implications of these distribu-tions for corpus design. The paper argues that theoretical research should be prior in corpus design, to identify the situational parameters that distinguish among texts in a speech community, and to identify the types of linguistic features that will be analysed in the corpus. These theoretical considerations should be complemented by empirical investigations of linguistic variation in a pilot corpus of texts, as a basis for specific sampling decisions. The actual construction of a corpus would then proceed in cycles: the original design based on theoretical and pilot-study analyses, followed by collection of texts, followed by further empirical investigations of lin-guistic variation and revision of the design.},

So, we can summarize the current support of Zipf's law in texts as anecdotic. We try to solve these issues by studying three different versions of Zipf's law and fitting them to all available English texts in the Project Gutenberg database (consisting of more than 30 000 texts). To do so we use state-of-the art tools in fitting and goodness-of-fit tests, carefully tailored to the peculiarities of text statistics. Remarkably, one of the three versions of Zipf's law, consisting of a pure power-law form in the complementary cumulative distribution function of word frequencies, is able to fit more than 40{\%} of the texts in the database (at the 0.05 significance level), for the whole domain of frequencies (from 1 to the maximum value), and with only one free parameter (the exponent).},

We report on experiments with a corpus that consists of newspaper articles about national current affairs by different journalists from the Belgian newspaper De Standaard. Because the documents are in a similar genre, register, and range of topics, token-based (e.g., sentence length) and lexical features (e.g., vocabulary richness) can be kept roughly constant over the different authors. This allows us to focus on the use of syntax-based features as possible predictors for an author's style, as well as on those token-based features that are predictive to author style more than to topic or register. These style characteristics are not under the author's conscious control and therefore good clues for Authorship Attribution. Machine Learning methods (TiMBL and the WEKA software package) are used to select informative combinations of syntactic, token-based and lexical features and to predict authorship of unseen documents.

The language models deployed in most state-of-the-art ASR and SMT systems are n-gram models. Several statistical frameworks have been proposed to build more complex models and " put (the syntactic structure of) language back into language modeling. " Yet, n-gram models, despite being linguistically nave, are still favored, because estimating them from text is well understood, they are computationally efficient, and integrating them into ASR and SMT systems is straightforward. This dissertation proposes novel algorithms and techniques that make it practical to estimate and apply more complex language models in ASR and SMT tasks, in particular syntactic modes for speech recognition. While yielding significantly better performance than n-gram models, the syntactic structured language models (SLM) can not be efficiently trained on a large amount of text data due to the impractical size of the resulting model.

After the important advancements obtained in the last years, text prediction methods may nowadays benefit anyone trying to input text messages or commands, if they are adequately integrated within the user interface of the application. Diverse text prediction methods are based in different statistic and linguistic properties of natural languages. Hence, they are very dependent on the language concerned. In order to discuss general issues of text prediction it is necessary to propose abstract descriptions of the methods used. In this paper a number of models applied to text prediction are presented. Some of them are oriented to low-inflected languages while others are for high-inflected languages. All these models have been implemented and their results are compared. Presented models may be useful for future discussion. Finally, some comments related to the comparison of previously published results are also done. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Search engines index tens to hundreds of millions of web pages involving a comparable number of distinct terms. They answer tens of millions of queries every day. Despite the importance of large-scale search engines on the web, very little academic research has been done on them. Furthermore, due to rapid advance in technology and web proliferation, creating a web search engine today is very different from 3 years ago. This paper provides an in-depth description of our large-scale web search engine - the first such detailed public description we know of to date. Apart from the problems of scaling traditional search techniques to data of this magnitude, there are new technical challenges involved with using the additional information present in hypertext to produce better search results.

Results indicated that word prediction had little to no effectiveness in increasing writing speed for all of the students in this study, but it shows promise in decreasing spelling and typographical errors.},

abstract = {A random sample is drawn from a population of animals of various species. (The theory may also be applied to studies of literary vocabulary, for example.) If a particular species is represented r times in the sample of size N, then r/N is not a good estimate of the population frequency, p, when r is small. Methods are given for estimating p, assuming virtually nothing about the underlying population. The estimates are expressed in terms of smoothed values of the numbers nr (r= 1, 2, 3, ...), where nr is the number of distinct species that are each represented r times in the sample. (nr may be described as ‘the frequency of the frequency r'.) Turing is acknowledged for the most interesting formula in this part of the work. An estimate of the proportion of the population represented by the species occurring in the sample is an immediate corollary. Estimates are made of measures of heterogeneity of the population, including Yule's ‘characteristic' and Shannon's ‘entropy'. Methods are then discussed that do depend on assumptions about the underlying population. It is here that most work has been done by other writers. It is pointed out that a hypothesis can give a good fit to the numbers nr but can give quite the wrong value for Yule's characteristic. An example of this is Fisher's fit to some data of Williams's on Macrolepidoptera.},

Cassandra of Troy had the gift of foreseeing but was cursed by Apollo that her predictions would never be believed. Her warnings of the destruction of Troy were ignored and to simplify, let's just say that things just didn't go well for her later. In this chapter we take up the somewhat less fraught topic of predicting words. What word, for example, is likely to follow Please turn your homework ... Hopefully, most of you concluded that a very likely word is in, or possibly over, but probably not refrigerator or the. In the following sections we will formalize this intuition by introducing models that assign a probability to each possible next word. The same models will also serve to assign a probability to an entire sentence. Such a model, for example, could predict that the following sequence has a much higher probability of appearing in a text: all of a sudden I notice three guys standing on the sidewalk},

abstract = {This thesis reports a study using a corpus of text messages in English (CorTxt) to explore linguistic features which define texting as a language variety. It focuses on how the language of texting, Txt, is shaped by texters actively fulfilling interpersonal goals. The thesis starts with an overview of the literature on texting, which indicates the need for thorough linguistic investigation of Txt based on a large dataset. It then places texting within the tradition of research into the speech-writing continuum, which highlights limitations of focusing on mode at the expense of other user-variables. The thesis also argues the need for inductive investigation alongside the quantitative corpus-based frameworks that dominate the field. A number of studies are then reported which explore the unconventional nature of Txt. Firstly, drawing on the argument that respelling constitutes a meaning-making resource, spelling variants are retrieved using word-frequency lists and categorised according to form and function. Secondly, identification of everyday creativity in CorTxt challenges studies focusing solely on spelling as a creative resource, and suggests that creativity plays an important role in texting because of, rather than despite, physical constraints. Thirdly, word frequency analysis suggests that the distinct order of the most frequent words in CorTxt can be explained with reference to the frequent phrases in which they occur. Finally, application of a spoken grammar model reveals similarities and differences between spoken and texted interaction. The distinct strands of investigation highlight, on the one hand, the extent to which texting differs from speech and, on the other, the role of user agency, awareness and choice in shaping Txt. The argument is made that this can be explained through performativity and, in particular, the observation that texters perform brevity, speech-like informality and group deviance in construing identities through Txt.},

abstract = {Soil functional stability is the capacity of soil functions to resist and recover from an environmental perturbation and can be used to evaluate soil health. It can be influenced by the presence of xenobiotics such as herbicides. The impact of a fresh 2,4-D contamination (36 mg kg-1 dry soil) on soil functional stability was evaluated by comparing the capacity of soil enzyme activities to resist and recover from a heat perturbation for both a clean and 2,4-D-contaminated soil. The functional stabilities of the soils (uniform sands, pH 6.9, 7{\%} (w/w) organic matter) were calculated using the relative soil stability index (RSSI). The RSSI scores indicate the proportion of potential enzyme activity the soil retains after a perturbation compared to the potential activity of an unperturbed soil. Six extra-cellular enzyme activities (acid and alkaline phosphatases, arylsulfatase, urease, protease and ??-glucosidase) were monitored in soil microcosms during a 15-day period. During this period, a 60 ??C heat perturbation was applied to the soil for 24 h. The activities of arylsulfatase and protease were found to be the most stable following heat perturbation obtaining the highest RSSI scores (87{\%} and 77{\%}, respectively). Urease activity showed the lowest RSSI score (38{\%}). Although all enzyme activities were inhibited by the presence of 2,4-D, the RSSI results indicated that contamination lowered the stability of only three enzyme activities (arylsulfatase, ??-glucosidase and urease). The RSSI adequately described resistance, recovery and recovery rate parameters and enabled differentiation between functional stabilities of clean and contaminated soil and between different soil types. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {On the day we first started putting this chapter together, soon-to-be-President-of-the-United-States Barack Obama announced his choice of vice-presidential running mate by sending a text message to journalists and Democratic Party senators and supporters. One not-so-restrained New York Times journalist characterized the event: 'Mr. Obama's use of the newfound medium is the widest use of texting by a presidential candidate in history.' The following morning, again in the USA, a National Public Radio journalist talked about 'the most highly anticipated text message in human history'. This already newsworthy event was evidently being given an added mediatized spin thanks to texting. No doubt like many readers of the current volume, we are not convinced of the historic proportions of the Obama campaign's text message. This was, however, certainly a communicative event loaded with pragmatic – and metapragmatic – force. Why choose to use texting to deliver this public message? (After all, supporters could just as easily have been notified by the ancient technology of email.) What did the choice of text message mean to voters? Why should it warrant such media interest? Why make so much fuss about a text message which bore so little resemblance to the millions of text messages sent every day by ordinary people around the world? In this chapter, we consider these matters by stepping back from the hyperbolic commentary on text messaging by journalists and the entertaining observations of popular writers. To this end, we start with a comprehensive but potted review of the scholarly, research-driven literature on text messaging; this work highlights the range of applications to which texting has been put as well as the ways in which sociolinguists, discourse analysts and other communication scholars have been attending to language in texting messaging. Shifting next to a more specifically pragmatic and metapragmatic focus, we present some of our own empirical research as a way to illustrate general phenomena covered in the wider scholarly literature and to ground text messaging as a pragmatic phenomenon. We close our chapter with some brief thoughts about gaps in the academic literature and possible directions for future research on the language of text messaging. Before we go any further, however, we offer the following brief account of text messaging as a digital technology.},

abstract = {Multi-dimensional (MD) analysis is a methodological approach that applies multivariate statistical techniques (especially factor analysis and cluster analysis) to the investigation of register variation in a language. The approach was originally developed to analyze the full range of spoken and written registers in a language. Early studies focused on English register variation (Biber 1985, 1986 and 1988), while later studies have applied the same approach to Somali, Korean, Tuvaluan, Taiwanese, and Spanish. Surprisingly, these studies have found some striking similarities in the underlying 'dimensions' that distinguish among spoken and written registers in these diverse languages. It is even more surprising that MD studies of restricted discourse domains have also uncovered dimensions that are similar in linguistic form and function to the more general studies of register variation. The present study presents an MD analysis of a single register: conversation. Three primary dimensions of variation are identified, and then cluster analysis is used to distinguish among six conversation text types. The dimensions and text types are interpreted in linguistic and functional terms. The author's expectations were that a unique set of dimensions would emerge to characterize the variation among conversational texts. Instead, the three dimensions identified here turn out to be closely related to dimensions identified in previous analyses of general register variation. Taken together with previous studies, the present study of conversation raises the possibility of universal dimensions of variation.},

The system is based on combined statistical and lexical methods and it uses robust language resources. Word prediction is particularly useful to minimise keystrokes for users with special needs, and to reduce misspellings for users having limited Italian proficiency. Word prediction can be effectively used in language learning, by suggesting correct and well-formed words to non-native users. This is significant, and particularly difficult to cope with, for inflected languages such as Italian, where the correct word form depends on the context. After describing the system, we evaluate its performances and, besides the high Keystrokes Saving, we show that FastType outclasses typical word prediction limitations getting outstanding results even over a very large dictionary of words.},

abstract = {Word completion is a basic technology for reducing the effort involved in text entry on mobile devices and in augmentative communication devices, where efficiency and ease of use are needed, but where a low memory footprint is also required. Standard solutions compress a lexicon into a suffix tree with a small memory footprint and high retrieval speed. Keystroke savings, a measurable correlate of text entry effort gain, typically improve when the algorithm would also take into account the previous word; however, this comes at the cost of a large footprint. We develop two word completion algorithms that encode the previous word in the input. The first algorithm utilizes a character buffer that includes a fixed number of recent keystrokes, including those belonging to previous words. The second algorithm includes the complete previous word as an extra input feature. In simulation studies, the first algorithm yields marked improvements in keystroke savings, but has a large memory footprint. The second algorithm can be tuned by frequency thresholding to have a small footprint, and be less than one order of magnitude slower than the baseline system, while its keystroke savings improve over the baseline.},

abstract = {Social media features a wide range of nonstandard spellings, many of which appear inspired by phonological variation. However, the nature of the connection between variation across the spoken and written modalities remains poorly understood. Are phono-logical variables transferred to writing on the level of graphemes, or is the larger system of contextual patterning also transferred? This paper considers orthographic coda deletions corresponding to the phonological variables of (ing) and (t,d). In both cases, orthography mirrors speech: reduction of the -ing suffix depends on the word's syntactic category, and reduction of the -t,-d suffix depends on the succeeding phonological context. These spellings are more frequently used in informal conversational contexts, and in areas with high propor-tions of African Americans, again mirroring the patterning of the associated phonological variables. This suggests a deep connection between variation in the two modalities, necessi-tating a new account of the production of cross-modal variation. (150 words)},

@article{Zurhellena,
abstract = {This article is one of a series of short essays, collectively titled " Further Explorations, " published as part of a special issue of Oral Tradition in honor of John Miles Foley's 65 th birthday and 2011 retirement. The surprise Festschrift, guest-edited by Lori and Scott Garner entirely without his knowledge, celebrates John's tremendous impact on studies in oral tradition through a series of essays contributed by his students from the University of Missouri-Columbia (1979-present) and from NEH Summer Seminars that he has directed (1987-1996). http://journal.oraltradition.org/issues/26ii In The Pathways Project, John Miles Foley (2011-) discusses briefly the social role of SMS (Short Message Service), suggesting that " even so-called text messaging, a misnomer of sizeable proportions given that the activity really amounts to a long-distance emergent communication enacted virtually, knits people together into interactive groups and keeps them connected and 'present' to one another. " 1 In this essay, I propose a merger of current research on text messaging and the study of oral traditions in order to shed light on the relationship between this new mode of communication and the workings of consciousness being transformed by the eAgora. Focusing first on the limitations of text messaging as a medium that unexpectedly encouraged language innovation, we can explore how text messaging language merges effective communicative practices from both oral and written technologies in order to generate more efficient communication within a newly-limited, writing-based technology. Moreover, in addition to its efficiency, the kind of linguistic play found in text messaging can be viewed as a source of pleasure for those who engage in texting (" texters "). Thus, by employing the discourse of orality and literacy, we can explain how text messaging, while impossible to imagine without the myriad writing technologies mastered before it, actually encourages its literacy-obsessed users to practice communicative techniques more often found within oral cultures, or more precisely, communicative techniques found in cultures in the incipient stages of literacy. Such cultures are ripe for language innovation precisely because they have begun to record knowledge but have not yet standardized the recording procedure. Coincident with a perspective that sees text messaging as bridging a consciousness gap between oral and literate cultures, then, is the recognition that close study of the ways in which text messaging reworks language could lead to fruitful discoveries about the most current ways in which Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC) directs human life toward ever-emerging horizons of consciousness. When David Crystal (2008) hyperbolized the emergence of text messaging in the following passage, this form of communication was already a well-developed medium. Nevertheless, his humorous figuring of text messaging's inception, while not quite accurate, highlights precisely the form's limits that made it such an unlikely competitor in the tightly-wound market of twenty-first-century technologies (173-74): Oral Tradition, 26/2 (2011): 637-624},

First, a model based on partial differential equations is proposed; with the appropriate initial conditions, we are able to design a interpolation language model that merges a word-based n-gram language model and a part-of-speech-based language model. Improvements in keystroke saving (KSS) and perplexity (PP) over the word-based n-gram language model and two other traditional interpola‐ tion models are obtained, considering two different task domains and three different languages.

abstract = {We study the problem of stochastic language modelling from the viewpoint of introducing suitable structures into the conditional probability distributions. The task of these distributions is to predict the probability of a new word by looking at M or even all predecessor words. The conventional approach is to limit M to 1 or 2 and to interpolate the resulting bigram and trigram models with a unigram model in a linear fashion. However, there are many other structures that can be used to model the probabilistic dependences between the predecessor word and the word to be predicted. The structures considered in this paper are: nonlinear interpolation as an alternative to linear interpolation; equivalence classes for word histories and single words; cache memory and word associations. For the optimal estimation of nonlinear and linear interpolation parameters, the leaving-one-out method is systematically used. For the determination of word equivalence classes in a bigram model, an automatic clustering procedure has been adapted. To capture long-distance dependences, we consider various models for word-by-word dependences; the cache model may be viewed as a special type of self-association. Experimental results are presented for two text databases, a German database and an English database},

abstract = {The eventual goal of a language model is to accu-rately predict the value of a missing word given its context. We present an approach to word prediction that is based on learning a representation for each word as a function of words and linguistics pred-icates in its context. This approach raises a few new questions that we address. First, in order to learn good word representations it is necessary to use an expressive representation of the context. We present a way that uses external knowledge to gener-ate expressive context representations, along with a learning method capable of handling the large num-ber of features generated this way that can, poten-tially, contribute to each prediction. Second, since the number of words "competing" for each predic-tion is large, there is a need to "focus the attention" on a smaller subset of these. We exhibit the contri-bution of a "focus of attention" mechanism to the performance of the word predictor. Finally, we de-scribe a large scale experimental study in which the approach presented is shown to yield significant im-provements in word prediction tasks.},

Ideally training and testing should be done on a large corpus of AAC text covering a variety of topics, but no such corpus exists. We discuss training and testing on a wide variety of corpora meant to approximate text from AAC users.

Inferences about the transformation and about the parameters of the linear model are made by computing the likelihood function and the relevant posterior distribution. The contributions of normality, homoscedasticity and additivity to the transformation are separated. The relation of the present methods to earlier procedures for finding transformations is discussed. The methods are illustrated with examples. 1.},

abstract = {Text prediction was initially proposed to help people with a low text composition speed to enhance their message composition. After the important advancements obtained in the last years, text prediction methods may nowadays benefit anyone trying to input text messages or commands, if they are adequately integrated within the user interface of the application. Diverse text prediction methods are based in different statistic and linguistic properties of natural languages. Hence, they are very dependent on the language concerned. In order to discuss general issues of text prediction it is necessary to propose abstract descriptions of the methods used. In this paper a number of models applied to text prediction are presented. Some of them are oriented to low-inflected languages while others are for high-inflected languages. All these models have been implemented and their results are compared. Presented models may be useful for future discussion. Finally, some comments related to the comparison of previously published results are also done. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The results show 31{\%} improvement over the traditional frequency based word estimation.

We discuss the properties of these algorithms and compare their performance using real life sequences from three domains: proteins, English text and music pieces. The comparison is made with respect to prediction quality as measured by the average log-loss. We also compare classification algorithms based on these predictors with respect to a number of large protein classification tasks. Our results indicate that a “decomposed ” CTW (a variant of the CTW algorithm) and PPM outperform all other algorithms in sequence prediction tasks. Somewhat surprisingly, a different algorithm, which is a modification of the Lempel-Ziv compression algorithm, significantly outperforms all algorithms on the protein classification problems. 1.},

abstract = {This chapter discusses cache-based language model for speech recognition. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) consists of two components: an acoustic component, which matches the acoustic input to words in its vocabulary, producing a set of the most plausible word candidates together with a probability for each, and the second component, which incorporates a language model, estimating the probability for each word in the vocabulary that it will occur, given a list of previously hypothesized words. The chapter focuses on the language model incorporated in the second component. A hypothesis is adopted in the chapter that a word used in the recent past is much more likely to be used sooner, from either its overall frequency in the language or that a 3g-gram model would suggest. The cache component of the combined model estimates the probability of a word from its recent frequency of use. The model uses a weighted average of the 3g-gram and cache components in calculating word probabilities, where the relative weights assigned to each component depend on the Part of Speech (POS). For purpose of comparison, a pure 3g-gram model has been created in the chapter, consisting of only the 3g-gram component of the combined model.},

abstract = {On the day we first started putting this chapter together, soon-to-be-President-of-the-United-States Barack Obama announced his choice of vice-presidential running mate by sending a text message to journalists and Democratic Party senators and supporters. One not-so-restrained New York Times journalist characterized the event: 'Mr. Obama's use of the newfound medium is the widest use of texting by a presidential candidate in history.' The following morning, again in the USA, a National Public Radio journalist talked about 'the most highly anticipated text message in human history'. This already newsworthy event was evidently being given an added mediatized spin thanks to texting. No doubt like many readers of the current volume, we are not convinced of the historic proportions of the Obama campaign's text message. This was, however, certainly a communicative event loaded with pragmatic – and metapragmatic – force. Why choose to use texting to deliver this public message? (After all, supporters could just as easily have been notified by the ancient technology of email.) What did the choice of text message mean to voters? Why should it warrant such media interest? Why make so much fuss about a text message which bore so little resemblance to the millions of text messages sent every day by ordinary people around the world? In this chapter, we consider these matters by stepping back from the hyperbolic commentary on text messaging by journalists and the entertaining observations of popular writers. To this end, we start with a comprehensive but potted review of the scholarly, research-driven literature on text messaging; this work highlights the range of applications to which texting has been put as well as the ways in which sociolinguists, discourse analysts and other communication scholars have been attending to language in texting messaging. Shifting next to a more specifically pragmatic and metapragmatic focus, we present some of our own empirical research as a way to illustrate general phenomena covered in the wider scholarly literature and to ground text messaging as a pragmatic phenomenon. We close our chapter with some brief thoughts about gaps in the academic literature and possible directions for future research on the language of text messaging. Before we go any further, however, we offer the following brief account of text messaging as a digital technology.},

abstract = {SMS or Text is one of the most popular forms of messaging. Yet, despite its immense popularity, SMS has remained unexamined by science. Not only that, but the commercial organisations, who have been forced to offer SMS by a demanding public, have had very little idea why it has been successful. Indeed, they have, until very recently, planned to replace SMS with other messaging services such as MMS. This book is the first to bring together scientific studies into the values that ‘texting' provides, examining both cultural variation in countries as different as the Philippines and Germany, as well as the differences between SMS and other communications channels like Instant Messaging and the traditional letter. It presents usability and design research which explores how SMS will evolve and what is likely to be the pattern of person-to-person messaging in the future. In short, Inside Text is a fundamental resource for anyone interested in mobile communications at the start of the 21st Century The book will be of interest to anyone in the CHI, CSCW and mobile communications research areas, as well as sociologists, anthropologists, communications scientists and policy makers.},

There is an enormous diversity of prediction methods and techniques mentioned in the literature. Therefore, the designer finds tremendous difficulties in understanding and comparing them in order to decide the most convenient technique for a specific design. This paper presents a survey on prediction techniques applied to communicators with the intention of helping them to understand this field. Prediction applications and related features, such as block size, dictionary structure, prediction method, interface, special features, measurement and results, are detailed. Systems found in the literature are studied and described. Finally, a discussion is carried out on the possible comparison among the different methods. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2004.},

abstract = {— -gram models are the most widely used language models in large vocabulary continuous speech recognition. Since the size of the model grows rapidly with respect to the model order and available training data, many methods have been proposed for pruning the least relevant -grams from the model. However, correct smoothing of the -gram probability distri-butions is important and performance may degrade significantly if pruning conflicts with smoothing. In this paper, we show that some of the commonly used pruning methods do not take into account how removing an -gram should modify the backoff distributions in the state-of-the-art Kneser–Ney smoothing. To solve this problem, we present two new algorithms: one for pruning Kneser–Ney smoothed models, and one for growing them incrementally. Experiments on Finnish and English text corpora show that the proposed pruning algorithm provides considerable improvements over previous pruning algorithms on Kneser–Ney-smoothed models and is also better than the baseline entropy pruned Good–Turing smoothed models. The models created by the growing algorithm provide a good starting point for our pruning algorithm, leading to further improvements. The improvements in the Finnish speech recognition over the other Kneser–Ney smoothed models are statistically significant, as well.},

abstract = {Clinical and epidemiologic evidence suggests that alcoholism complicated by concurrent or a lifetime history of depression is slower to remit and more prone to relapse than uncomplicated alcoholism. Consequently, alcoholics with a history of depressive illness, on average, are likely to use more health care and to have higher treatment costs than those without depression complications. This article contrasts evidence of the suitability of three models for predicting the impact of depression on an alcoholic's health-care use: a null model (assuming no differences) a cumulative-effect model (arguing for a linear increase associated with comorbid depression), and a synergistic model (wherein alcoholism complicated with depression is qualitatively as well as quantitatively different than uncomplicated alcoholism). To test these models, health-care costs and utilization of 491 ``pure'' alcoholics (those with no history of depression diagnosis) and 199 depression-complicated alcoholics, who received alcohol treatment while enrolled in a self-insured health-care program of a major U.S. manufacturing company, were compared. Results are discussed in terms of the implications for cost containment and the likelihood of relapse among the depression-complicated alcoholism group.},

abstract = {The frequency distribution of words has been a key object of study in statistical linguistics for the past 70 years. This distribution approximately follows a simple mathematical form known as Zipf 's law. This paper first shows that human language has highly complex, reliable structure in the frequency distribution over and above this classic law, though prior data visualization methods obscured this fact. A number of empirical phenomena related to word frequencies are then reviewed. These facts are chosen to be informative about the mechanisms giving rise to Zipf's law, and are then used to evaluate many of the theoretical explanations of Zipf's law in language. No prior account straightforwardly explains all the basic facts, nor is supported with independent evaluation of its underlying assumptions. To make progress at understanding why language obeys Zipf's law, studies must seek evidence beyond the law itself, testing assumptions and evaluating novel predictions with new, independent data.},

abstract = {Word completion is a basic technology for reducing the effort involved in text entry on mobile devices and in augmentative communication devices, where efficiency and ease of use are needed, but where a low memory footprint is also required. Standard solutions compress a lexicon into a suffix tree with a small memory footprint and high retrieval speed. Keystroke savings, a measurable correlate of text entry effort gain, typically improve when the algorithm would also take into account the previous word; however, this comes at the cost of a large footprint. We develop two word completion algorithms that encode the previous word in the input. The first algorithm utilizes a character buffer that includes a fixed number of recent keystrokes, including those belonging to previous words. The second algorithm includes the complete previous word as an extra input feature. In simulation studies, the first algorithm yields marked improvements in keystroke savings, but has a large memory footprint. The second algorithm can be tuned by frequency thresholding to have a small footprint, and be less than one order of magnitude slower than the baseline system, while its keystroke savings improve over the baseline.},

@article{McCarthy2010,
abstract = {The main purpose of this study was to examine the validity of the approach to lexical diversity assessment known as the measure of textual lexical diversity (MTLD). The index for this approach is calculated as the mean length of word strings that maintain a criterion level of lexical variation. To validate the MTLD approach, we compared it against the performances of the primary competing indices in the field, which include vocd-D, TTR, Maas, Yule's K, and an HD-D index derived directly from the hypergeometric distribution function. The comparisons involved assessments of convergent validity, divergent validity, internal validity, and incremental validity. The results of our assessments of these indices across two separate corpora suggest three major findings. First, MTLD performs well with respect to all four types of validity and is, in fact, the only index not found to vary as a function of text length. Second, HD-D is a viable alternative to the vocd-D standard. And third, three of the indices--MTLD, vocd-D (or HD-D), and Maas--appear to capture unique lexical information. We conclude by advising researchers to consider using MTLD, vocd-D (or HD-D), and Maas in their studies, rather than any single index, noting that lexical diversity can be assessed in many ways and each approach may be informative as to the construct under investigation.},

We identify and evaluate techniques for improving English part-of-speech tagging performance in this genre. Further, we present a novel approach to system combination for the case where available taggers use different tagsets, based on voteconstrained bootstrapping with unlabeled data. Coupled with assigning prior probabilities to some tokens and handling of unknown words and slang, we reach 88.7{\%} tagging accuracy (90.5{\%} on development data). This is a new high in PTB-compatible tweet part-of-speech tagging, reducing token error by 26.8{\%} and sentence error by 12.2{\%}. The model, training data and tools are made available.},

abstract = {We study the problem of stochastic language modelling from the viewpoint of introducing suitable structures into the conditional probability distributions. The task of these distributions is to predict the probability of a new word by looking at M or even all predecessor words. The conventional approach is to limit M to 1 or 2 and to interpolate the resulting bigram and trigram models with a unigram model in a linear fashion. However, there are many other structures that can be used to model the probabilistic dependences between the predecessor word and the word to be predicted. The structures considered in this paper are: nonlinear interpolation as an alternative to linear interpolation; equivalence classes for word histories and single words; cache memory and word associations. For the optimal estimation of nonlinear and linear interpolation parameters, the leaving-one-out method is systematically used. For the determination of word equivalence classes in a bigram model, an automatic clustering procedure has been adapted. To capture long-distance dependences, we consider various models for word-by-word dependences; the cache model may be viewed as a special type of self-association. Experimental results are presented for two text databases, a German database and an English database},

abstract = {The increasingly widespread use of text -messaging has led to the questioning of the social and psychological effects of this novel communication medium. A selection of findings from an online questionnaire that was developed by the author to answer this pertinent question are presented. McKenna's recent work on the way the Internet can help some people develop relationships is drawn upon and taken a step further by exploring the differences between those who prefer texting ('Texters') and those who prefer talking on their mobiles ('Talkers'). A large sample of 982 respondents completed the questionnaire. Results showed there was a clear distinction between Texters and Talkers in the way they used their mobiles and their underlying motivations. The key finding to emerge in the preliminary analyses was that Texters seemed to form close knit 'text circles' with their own social ecology, interconnecting with a close group of friends in perpetual text contact. Compared to Talkers, Texters were found to be more lonely and socially anxious, and more likely to disclose their 'real-self' through text than via face-to-face or voice call exchanges. S tructural equation modeling produced a model showing that where respondents located their real-self and whether they were a Texter or a Talker mediated between the loneliness and social anxiety measures and the impact of these on relational outcomes, in line with McKenna's theoretical framework. Thus it appears that there is something special about texting that allows some people to translate their loneliness and/or social anxiety into productive relationships whilst for others the mobile does not afford the same effect. .Applications and explorations for future research are discussed.},

abstract = {—Using social media tools such as blogs and forums have become more and more popular in recent years. Hence, a huge collection of social media texts from different communities is available for accessing user opinions, e.g., for marketing studies or acceptance research. Typically, methods from Natural Language Processing are applied to social media texts to automatically recognize user opinions. A fundamental component of the linguistic pipeline in Natural Language Processing is Part-of-Speech tagging. Most state-of-the-art Part-of-Speech taggers are trained on newspaper corpora, which differ in many ways from non-standardized social media text. Hence, applying common taggers to such texts results in performance degradation. In this paper, we present extensions to a basic Markov model tagger for the annotation of social media texts. Considering the German standard Stuttgart/ ubinger TagSet (STTS), we distinguish 54 tag classes. Applying our approach improves the tagging accuracy for social media texts considerably, when we train our model on a combination of annotated texts from newspapers and Web comments.},

abstract = {This article is one of a series of short essays, collectively titled " Further Explorations, " published as part of a special issue of Oral Tradition in honor of John Miles Foley's 65 th birthday and 2011 retirement. The surprise Festschrift, guest-edited by Lori and Scott Garner entirely without his knowledge, celebrates John's tremendous impact on studies in oral tradition through a series of essays contributed by his students from the University of Missouri-Columbia (1979-present) and from NEH Summer Seminars that he has directed (1987-1996). http://journal.oraltradition.org/issues/26ii In The Pathways Project, John Miles Foley (2011-) discusses briefly the social role of SMS (Short Message Service), suggesting that " even so-called text messaging, a misnomer of sizeable proportions given that the activity really amounts to a long-distance emergent communication enacted virtually, knits people together into interactive groups and keeps them connected and 'present' to one another. " 1 In this essay, I propose a merger of current research on text messaging and the study of oral traditions in order to shed light on the relationship between this new mode of communication and the workings of consciousness being transformed by the eAgora. Focusing first on the limitations of text messaging as a medium that unexpectedly encouraged language innovation, we can explore how text messaging language merges effective communicative practices from both oral and written technologies in order to generate more efficient communication within a newly-limited, writing-based technology. Moreover, in addition to its efficiency, the kind of linguistic play found in text messaging can be viewed as a source of pleasure for those who engage in texting (" texters "). Thus, by employing the discourse of orality and literacy, we can explain how text messaging, while impossible to imagine without the myriad writing technologies mastered before it, actually encourages its literacy-obsessed users to practice communicative techniques more often found within oral cultures, or more precisely, communicative techniques found in cultures in the incipient stages of literacy. Such cultures are ripe for language innovation precisely because they have begun to record knowledge but have not yet standardized the recording procedure. Coincident with a perspective that sees text messaging as bridging a consciousness gap between oral and literate cultures, then, is the recognition that close study of the ways in which text messaging reworks language could lead to fruitful discoveries about the most current ways in which Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC) directs human life toward ever-emerging horizons of consciousness. When David Crystal (2008) hyperbolized the emergence of text messaging in the following passage, this form of communication was already a well-developed medium. Nevertheless, his humorous figuring of text messaging's inception, while not quite accurate, highlights precisely the form's limits that made it such an unlikely competitor in the tightly-wound market of twenty-first-century technologies (173-74): Oral Tradition, 26/2 (2011): 637-624},

abstract = {Concerns over effects of 'textisms' on literacy have been reinforced by research identifying processing costs associated with reading textisms. But to what extent do such studies reflect actual textism use? This study examined the textual characteristics of 936 text messages in English (13391 words). Message length, nonstandard spelling, sender and message characteristics and word frequency were analyzed. The data showed that 25{\%} of word content used nonstandard spelling, the most frequently occurring category involving omission of capital letters. Types of nonstandard spelling varied only slightly depending on the purpose of the text message, while the overall proportion of nonstandard spelling did not differ significantly. Less than 0.2{\%} of content was 'semantically unrecoverable.' Implications for experimental studies of textisms are discussed. Text messaging, short message service (SMS) or 'texting' continues to be a popular means of communi-cation, among young people in particular. A report by Lenhart, Ling, Campbell, and Purcell (2010) high-lighted the rapid increase in text messaging in the United States, where 72{\%} of teenagers use text messag-ing, compared to 51{\%} in 2006. In a British survey, 52{\%} of young people aged 11-18 (n = 1000), along with 28{\%} of adults aged 18-65 (n = 2000), named texting as the most important form of communication that they use to stay in touch with friends (Mobile Life Report, 2008); for the young people surveyed, texting ranked above instant messaging (17{\%}), e-mail (12{\%}), calls via mobile (9{\%}) or landline (10{\%}), and letters (0{\%}). A British survey of 2117 adults shows the increasing popularity of texting from 2005 to 2010, with 62{\%} of those aged 16-24 preferring texting over other means of communicating with friends (Ofcom, 2011). Ling's (2010) cross-sectional analysis suggests that texting follows a life-phase pattern, with older teens and those in their early 20s making the most use of the medium, with usage dropping off with age. The authors would like to thank Maria Bakardjieva and two anonymous reviewers for helpful criticisms and suggestions regarding data presentation and analysis.},

abstract = {Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and odds of major depression and the incremental effect of major depression on utilization, lost productivity and functional disability in individuals with common chronic medical disorders. Method: Data on 30,801 adults from the 1999 National Health Interview Survey were analyzed. The 12-month prevalence and age/sex-adjusted odds of major depression were calculated for adults with hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), stroke or cerebrovascular accident (CVA), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The association between chronic condition status (with and without major depression) and utilization, lost productivity and functional disability was determined by controlling for covariates. Results: The 12-month prevalence and age/sex-adjusted odds of major depression by chronic conditions were as follows: CHF, 7.9{\%} [odds ratio (OR)=1.96]; HTN, 8.0{\%} (OR=2.00); DM, 9.3{\%} (OR=1.96); CAD, 9.3{\%} (OR=2.30); CVA, 11.4{\%} (OR=3.15); COPD, 15.4{\%} (OR=3.21); ESRD, 17.0{\%} (OR=3.56); any chronic condition, 8.8{\%} (OR=2.61). Compared to adults without chronic conditions, those with chronic conditions plus major depression had greater odds of ???1 ambulatory visit [OR=1.50; 95{\%} confidence interval (95{\%} CI)=1.28, 1.77]; ???1 emergency room visit (OR=1.94; 95{\%} CI=1.55, 2.45); and ???1 day in bed due to illness (OR=1.60; 95{\%} CI=1.28, 2.00); and functional disability (OR=2.48; 95{\%} CI=1.96, 3.15). Conclusion: The 12-month prevalence and odds of major depression are high in individuals with chronic medical conditions, and major depression is associated with significant increases in utilization, lost productivity and functional disability. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

We analyzed the effects of the writers' characteristics (age, gender, and SMS-messaging experience) on message length (number of characters and number of words), dialogue structure (with or without an opening and a closing), and message function (informative vs. relational). The SMS messages were produced in a real-world situation. We found differences across writers' characteristics for all the dependant variables. The commonly reported distinctions between girls and boys were mitigated. Moreover, for dialogical structure, the messages differed from those found in traditional oral and written interactions since 73{\%} of them did not have the conventional opening-message-closing format (the opening and/or the closing was missing). The results are discussed in terms of the specific characteristics that define the SMS register, and potentially relevant approaches to be taken in future research are addressed.},

abstract = {—Using social media tools such as blogs and forums have become more and more popular in recent years. Hence, a huge collection of social media texts from different communities is available for accessing user opinions, e.g., for marketing studies or acceptance research. Typically, methods from Natural Language Processing are applied to social media texts to automatically recognize user opinions. A fundamental component of the linguistic pipeline in Natural Language Processing is Part-of-Speech tagging. Most state-of-the-art Part-of-Speech taggers are trained on newspaper corpora, which differ in many ways from non-standardized social media text. Hence, applying common taggers to such texts results in performance degradation. In this paper, we present extensions to a basic Markov model tagger for the annotation of social media texts. Considering the German standard Stuttgart/ ubinger TagSet (STTS), we distinguish 54 tag classes. Applying our approach improves the tagging accuracy for social media texts considerably, when we train our model on a combination of annotated texts from newspapers and Web comments.},

This distribution approximately follows a simple mathematical form known as Zipf 's law. This paper first shows that human language has highly complex, reliable structure in the frequency distribution over and above this classic law, though prior data visualization methods obscured this fact. A number of empirical phenomena related to word frequencies are then reviewed. These facts are chosen to be informative about the mechanisms giving rise to Zipf's law, and are then used to evaluate many of the theoretical explanations of Zipf's law in language. No prior account straightforwardly explains all the basic facts, nor is supported with independent evaluation of its underlying assumptions. To make progress at understanding why language obeys Zipf's law, studies must seek evidence beyond the law itself, testing assumptions and evaluating novel predictions with new, independent data.},

abstract = {Background Quantification of the disease burden caused by different risks informs prevention by providing an account of health loss different to that provided by a disease-by-disease analysis. No complete revision of global disease burden caused by risk factors has been done since a comparative risk assessment in 2000, and no previous analysis has assessed changes in burden attributable to risk factors over time. Methods We estimated deaths and disability-adjusted life years; DALYs; sum of years lived with disability [YLD] and years of life lost [YLL]) attributable to the independent effects of 67 risk factors and clusters of risk factors for 21 regions in 1990 and 2010. We estimated exposure distributions for each year, region, sex, and age group, and relative risks per unit of exposure by systematically reviewing and synthesising published and unpublished data. We used these estimates, together with estimates of cause-specific deaths and DALYs from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010, to calculate the burden attributable to each risk factor exposure compared with the theoretical-minimum-risk exposure. We incorporated uncertainty in disease burden, relative risks, and exposures into our estimates of attributable burden. Findings In 2010, the three leading risk factors for global disease burden were high blood pressure (7 0{\%} [95{\%} uncertainty interval 6 2-7 7] of global DALYs); tobacco smoking including second-hand smoke (6 3{\%} [5 5-7 0]), and alcohol use (5 5{\%} [5 0-5 9]). In 1990, the leading risks were childhood underweight (7 9{\%} [6 8-9 4]), household air pollution from solid fuels; (HAP; 7 0{\%} [5 6-8 3]), and tobacco smoking including second-hand smoke (6 1{\%} [5 4-6 8]). Dietary risk factors and physical inactivity collectively accounted for 10 0{\%} (95{\%} UI 9 2-10 8) of global DALYs in 2010, with the most prominent dietary risks being diets low in fruits and those high in sodium. Several risks that primarily affect childhood communicable diseases, including unimproved water and sanitation and childhood micronutrient deficiencies, fell in rank between 1990 and 2010, with unimproved water ' and sanitation accounting for 0 9{\%} (0 4-1 6) of global DALYs in 2010. However, in most of sub-Saharan Africa childhood underweight, HAP, and non-exclusive and discontinued breastfeeding were the leading risks in 2010, while HAP was the leading risk in south Asia. The leading risk factor in Eastern Europe, most of Latin America, and southern sub-Saharan Africa in 2010 was alcohol use; in most of Asia, North Africa and Middle East, and central Europe it was high blood pressure. Despite declines, tobacco smoking including second-hand smoke remained the leading risk in high-income north America and western Europe. High body-mass index has increased globally and it is the leading risk in Australasia and southern Latin America, and also ranks high in other high-income regions, North Africa and Middle East, and Oceania. Interpretation Worldwide, the contribution of different risk factors to disease burden has changed substantially, with a shift away from risks for communicable diseases in children towards those for non-communicable diseases in adults. These changes are related to the ageing population, decreased mortality among children younger than 5 years, changes in cause-of-death composition, and changes in risk factor exposures. New evidence has led to changes in the magnitude of key risks including unimproved water and sanitation, vitamin A and zinc deficiencies, and ambient particulate matter pollution. The extent to which the epidemiological shift has occurred and what the leading risks currently are varies greatly across regions. In much of sub-Saharan Africa, the leading risks are still those associated with poverty and those that affect children.},

While there is research on the use of written forms of computer-mediated communication in the US using full keyboards (e.g., chat, email, instant messaging), we know relatively little about mobile telephony as an American form of electronically-mediated communication. To address this lacuna, we administered questionnaires using convenience sampling to American college students on two campuses regarding their use of mobile phones for both talking and texting. The results suggest that the mobile phone platform is still a medium in transition but that some usage patterns may be gender-driven or economically-based, and that others may be distinctive to American culture.},

abstract = {Bellcore How do people know as much as they do with as little information as they get? The problem takes many forms; learning vocabulary from text is an especially dramatic and convenient case for research. A new general theory of acquired similarity and knowledge representation, latent semantic analysis (LSA), is presented and used to successfully simulate such learning and several other psycholinguistic phenomena. By inducing global knowledge indirectly from local co-occurrence data in a large body of representative text, LSA acquired knowledge about the full vocabulary of English at a comparable rate to schoolchildren. LSA uses no prior linguistic or perceptual similarity knowledge; it is based solely on a general mathematical learning method that achieves powerful inductive effects by ex-tracting the right number of dimensions (e.g., 300) to represent objects and contexts. Relations to other theories, phenomena, and problems are sketched. Prologue "How much do we know at any time? Much more, or so I believe, than we know we know!" —Agatha Christie, The Moving Finger A typical American seventh grader knows the meaning of 10-15 words today that she did not know yesterday. She must have acquired most of them as a result of reading because (a) the majority of English words are used only in print, (b) she already knew well almost all the words she would have encoun-tered in speech, and (c) she learned less than one word by direct instruction. Studies of children reading grade-school text find that about one word in every 20 paragraphs goes from wrong to right on a vocabulary test. The typical seventh grader would have read less than 50 paragraphs since yesterday, from which she should have learned less than three new words. Apparently, she mastered the meanings of many words that she did not encounter. Evidence for all these assertions is given in detail later. This phenomenon offers an ideal case in which to study a problem that has plagued philosophy and science since Plato We thank Karen Lochbaum for valuable help in analysis; George Furnas for early ideas and inspiration; Peter Foltz, Walter Kintsch, and Ernie Mross for unpublished data; and for helpful comments on the ideas and drafts, we thank, in alphabetic order, 24 centuries ago, the fact that people have much more knowl-edge than appears to be present in the information to which they have been exposed. Plato's solution, of course, was that people must come equipped with most of their knowledge and need only hints and contemplation to complete it. In this article we suggest a very different hypothesis to explain the mystery of excessive learning. It rests on the simple notion that some domains of knowledge contain vast numbers of weak interrelations that, if properly exploited, can greatly amplify learning by a process of inference. We have discovered that a very simple mechanism of induction, the choice of the correct dimensionality in which to represent similarity between objects and events, can sometimes, in particular in learning about the similarity of the meanings of words, produce sufficient enhance-ment of knowledge to bridge the gap between the information available in local contiguity and what people know after large amounts of experience.

abstract = {Word prediction may be of great help in situations where text entering is cumbersome due to a physical or a cognitive disability, or due to the input device being small. Traditionally, word prediction has solely been based on statistic language modelling, but lately knowledge-based approaches, including the use of grammatical language descriptions, have entered the arena. By making use of grammar rules, the accuracy of the prediction suggestions is expected to increase, and the word predictor to give a more intelligent impression. We have defined and implemented a Swedish grammar for the FASTY word predictor. The gram- mar rules, defined in terms of traditional grammatical functions, are expressed in the procedural UCP- formalism. The grammar functions as a grammar checking filter, reranking the suggestions proposed by a statistic n-gram model on the basis of both confirming and rejecting rules. What structures to cover has been decided in accordance with an investigation on what syntactic errors are most frequently produced by the statistic model. The investigation led us to prioritize rules for handling word order in the main clause, agreement within the noun phrase, verb inflection and prepositional phrases. A preliminary evaluation of the grammar module was carried out, using Keystroke Saving Rate (KSR) estimations. The results showed only a slight improvement in KSR when adding the grammar module to the system, as compared to using only the statistic model based on word form bigrams and part-of-speech tag trigrams. A list length of one suggestion gave a larger improvement, than a list length of five, indicating that the strength of the grammar module lies in the reranking of already displayed suggestions, rather than the addition of new suggestions to a long list of suggestions.},

McKennas recent work on the way the Internet can help some people develop relationships is drawn upon and taken a step further by exploring the differences between those who prefer texting (Texters) and those who prefer talking on their mobiles (Talkers). A large sample of 982 respondents completed the questionnaire. Results showed there was a clear distinction between Texters and Talkers in the way they used their mobiles and their underlying motivations. The key finding to emerge in the preliminary analyses was that Texters seemed to form close knit text circles with their own social ecology, interconnecting with a close group of friends in perpetual text contact. Compared to Talkers, Texters were found to be more lonely and socially anxious, and more likely to disclose their real-self through text than via face-toface or voice call exchanges. Structural equation modeling produced a model showing that where respondents located their real-self and whether they were a Texter or a Talker mediated between the loneliness and social anxiety measures and the impact of these on relational outcomes, in line with McKennas theoretical framework. Thus it appears that there is something special about texting that allows some people to translate their loneliness and/or social anxiety into productive relationships whilst for others the mobile does not afford the same effect. .Applications and explorations for future research are discussed.},

An FLM represents words as bundles of features (e.g., morphological classes, stems, data-driven clusters, etc.), and induces a probability model covering sequences of bundles rather than just words. GPB extends standard backoff to general conditional probability tables where variables might be heterogeneous types, where no obvious natural (temporal) backoff order exists, and where multiple dynamic backoff strategies are allowed. These methodologies were implemented during the JHU 2002 workshop as extensions to the SRI language modeling toolkit. This paper provides initial perplexity results on both CallHome Arabic and on Penn Treebank Wall Street Journal articles. Significantly, FLMs with GPB can produce bigrams with significantly lower perplexity, sometimes lower than highly-optimized baseline trigrams. In a multi-pass speech recognition context, where bigrams are used to create first-pass bigram lattices or N-best lists, these results are highly relevant.},

The mapping from informal word to its proper English words is done using Double Metaphone Encoding based on their phonetic similarity. The results show 31{\%} improvement over the traditional frequency based word estimation.

SMS messaging can also be used to interact with automated systems or participating in contests. With tremendous increase in Mobile Text Messaging, there is a need for an efficient text input system. With limited keys on the mobile phone, multiple letters are mapped to same number (8 keys, 2 to 9, for 26 alphabets).

abstract = {The transformative trends of the past 50 years that have led to a sharp decline in marriage and a rise of new family forms have been shaped by attitudes and behaviors that differ by class, age and race, according to a new Pew Research Center nationwide survey complemented by an analysis of demographic and economic data from the U.S. Census Bureau. A new ―marriage gap‖ in the United States is increasingly aligned with a growing income gap. Marriage, while declining among all groups, remains the norm for adults with a college education and good income but is now markedly less prevalent among those on the lower rungs of the socio-economic ladder. The survey finds that those in this less-advantaged group are as likely as others to want to marry, but they place a higher premium on economic security as a condition for marriage. This is a bar that many may not meet. The survey also finds striking differences by generation. In 1960, two-thirds (68{\%}) of all twenty-somethings were married. In 2008, just 26{\%} were. How many of today's youth will eventually marry is an open question. For now, the survey finds that the young are much more inclined than their elders to view cohabitation without marriage and other new family forms — such as same sex marriage and interracial marriage — in a positive light. Even as marriage shrinks, family— in all its emerging varieties — remains resilient. The survey finds that Americans have an expansive definition of what constitutes a family. And the vast majority of adults consider their own family to be the most important, most satisfying element of their lives.},

To play the Shannon game, one must predict which words are most likely to follow a given segment of English Text. Word Prediction would be most useful for writers with physical disabilities and severe spelling problems. The aim of this paper is to improve on existing results by writing a program that is capable of automatically inferring a grammar from a Natural Language Corpus, and applying this to the Shannon Game. To play the Shannon Game, a stochastic Grammar for an approximation to the target language must be inferred from a text sample, and as the quality of this grammar improves so too does the quality of the predictor that uses the inferred grammar. The proposed algorithm in the paper uses Support Vector Machine to perform the part of speech tagging which produces 97.6{\%} correct predictions.},

abstract = {Text mining is an emerging technology that can be used to augment existing data in corporate databases by making unstructured text data available for analysis. An excellent introduction to text mining is provided by Weiss, et al. (2005). Francis (2006) provides a short introduction to text mining with a focus on insurance applications. One of the difficulties in getting started with text mining is acquiring the tools, i.e., the software for implementing text mining. Much of the software is expensive and/or difficult to use. For instance, some of the software requires purchase of expensive data mining suites. Other commercial software is more suited to large scale industrial strength applications such as cataloging and searching academic papers. One innovation that has made budget-friendly software available to text miners is open source software. Two of the very popular open source products that will be featured in this paper are R and Perl. R is a programming language that has wide acceptance for statistical and applied mathematical applications. Perl is a programming language that is particularly strong in text processing. Both languages can be easily downloaded from the Internet. Moreover, a large body of literature now exists to guide users through specialized applications such as text mining. This paper will rely heavily on information in the book Practical Text Mining in Perl by Roger Bilisoly (2008) when illustrating text mining applications in Perl. It will also rely heavily on the R tm library. While this library is described by Feinerer, Hornik, and Meyer (2008), the applications are not insurance applications, and a significant amount of trial and error can be required to achieve successful application of the software to insurance problems. We hope to make it easier for potential users to employ Perl and/or R for insurance text mining projects by illustrating their application to insurance problems with detailed information on the code and functions needed to perform the different text mining tasks. In this paper we will illustrate the application of the text mining software using two applications: 1) analyzing a free-form accident description field in an insurance claims database and 2) analyzing free-form comments in a survey of actuaries. Both applications involve relatively small text fields, compared to those anticipated by many text mining products. We will also show how text mining can be used to generate new information from the unstructured text data.},

abstract = {The eventual goal of a language model is to accurately predict the value of a missing word given its context. We present an approach to word prediction that is based on learning a representation for each word as a function of words and linguistics predicates in its context. This approach raises a few new questions that we address. First, in order to learn good word representations it is necessary to use an expressive representation of the context. We present a way that uses external knowledge to generate expressive context representations, along with a learning method capable of handling the large number of features generated this way that can, potentially, contribute to each prediction. Second, since the number of words ``competing'' for each prediction is large, there is a need to ``focus the attention'' on a smaller subset of these. We exhibit the contribution of a ``focus of attention'' mechanism to the performance of the word predictor. Finally, we describe a large scale experimental study in which the approach presented is shown to yield significant improvements in word prediction tasks.},

@article{Bahl1983,
abstract = {Speech recognition is formulated as a problem of maximum likelihood decoding. This formulation requires statistical models of the speech production process. In this paper, we describe a number of statistical models for use in speech recognition. We give special attention to determining the parameters for such models from sparse data. We also describe two decoding methods, one appropriate for constrained artificial languages and one appropriate for more realistic decoding tasks. To illustrate the usefulness of the methods described, we review a number of decoding results that have been obtained with them.},
